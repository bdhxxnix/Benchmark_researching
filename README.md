# My PLA Benchmark

This repository benchmarks various Piecewise Linear Approximation (PLA) algorithms like `GreedyPLA`, `OptimalPLA`, `SwingFilter` used in learned indexes (e.g. PGM-Index, FITing-Tree).

## Features
- Parallel FRS and Greedy implementations
- Easy-to-run benchmarking scripts
- Plots and analysis

## Getting Started
Clone the repo and install dependencies:
```bash
